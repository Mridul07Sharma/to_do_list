## To Do List
The Project **To do list** is made using *JavaScript, HTML and CSS*.

The basic Markup is Written in **HTML** and The Styling is done using **CSS**.
**JavaScript** Makes this project interactive.
 We can add the new task using the input field in project and then click on the submit button. The task will appear in the *To Do List.* We can delete the task whenever it is completed or we can also delete multiple tasks using Delete all button. The project has a good user Interface.  

 ##### Technologies used: 
 1. **HTML**: It is used as the basic markup Language. All the content of the Project is written in HTML. I have used various elements like div, form, input, hr, ol(ordered list), li, button etc. JavaScript is linked to the HTML page using the script tag and css is linked by using link tag. Elements are given id's and classes so that they can be styled and selected using them.

 2. **CSS and BootStrap** : Cascading Style Sheets is used for styling and layout the project. It is used to make project attractive. BootStrap is a CSS framework used for making the project responsive. I provides prestyled elements that can be directly embedded into our project. We have link bootstrap stylesheet and javascript from cdn so that bootstrap can be used in our project. Styling like changing background color, font size, using borders are easily done using CSS. I have used css flex box and css grid in this project for making the table for making the to do list.

 3. **JavaScript**: It is used to make the project interactive and functionable. Various logics for the project are written in javaScript. First of all I have used querySelectors to select various **HTML** elements. Then I hve created a function for adding date and time to the to do list. Date has been added using a pre defined javaScript object and it is updated using setInterval function, Time is updated every second by seting the time period as 1000ms in setinterval function. Then event listener is added to  HTML form and it auto submission functionality is changed using preventdefault attribute.The content for to do list is added in the li element and then Li elements are added into ordered list using append attribute. Then logic for delete all and delete last button is written and event listener for click is added to them.
